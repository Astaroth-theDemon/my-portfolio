    <h1>About me</h1>
    <div class="container">
    <p> Hello everyone, I am John Michael D. Yere. I'm from the Province of Ilocos Sur and 
         I live in the Barangay Dardarat, Municipality of Cabugao, I'm 22 year old. In June 5, 2025, I graduated 
         Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at University of Northern Philippines, Tamag, Vigan City, Ilocos Sur. </p>
    
    <p>When I was in school, we create our Capstone Project titled "MVITOUR: WEB-BASED METRO VIGAN
        TOUR RECOMMENDER SYSTEM". While we were working our project, we take the OJT for our final requirements for graduation. 
        I deployed at the office of other colleges of our school, we choose near area to for the OJT because it is to communicate to our teamates and to 
        our panel members for the queries. We did it until we finished our project and ready for final defense, and until we submitted our book. </p>
    
    <p>As a fresh gradute, I have no experience in a workplace and I have some weaknesses that I need to improve and to enhance, such as lack of confidence because 
        of shyness and being nervous, especially when first time for meeting a person like an interview, and my strength was easy to adapt places.</p>
    
        <p>So, when I have chances to work to a company, I'm willing to apply my knowledge as an BSInfoTech gradute, and to do my best to work and to help everyone
        for the success of the company. </p>
